# softbots
Simulation, evolution, and rendering of "soft robots" in Python.

Within `tensor`, the `test_` nomenclature is used because this was developed for use of the `evolve` module with Google Colab. 
These implementations of hill climber and random search were extracted from that. 
They attempt to incorporate a more streamlined tensor-based simulation code, which is still a work in progress.
